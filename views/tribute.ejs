          <h3 class="headline">Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1856</strong> - Born on 10 July in Smiljan, Austrian Empire
              (modern-day Croatia)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1875</strong> - Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in
              Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his first
              year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades
              possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required),
              started a Serb cultural club, and even received a letter of
              commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father,
              which stated, "Your son is a star of first rank." 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work
              under Tivadar Pusk\E1s at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone
              Exchange. During his employment, Tesla made many
              improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have
              perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never
              patented nor publicly described.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1884</strong> - Tesla emigrated to the United States. He
              began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's
              Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several
              hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field
              engineers" struggling with the task of building the large electric
              utility in that city.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran
              on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly
              expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages
              in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used
              polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn
              the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in
              1882). This innovative electric motor was a simple self-starting
              design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and
              the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing
              mechanical brushes.

            <li>
              <strong>1894</strong> - Tesla began investigating what he referred
              to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed
              damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later
              identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-Rays"). His early experiments
              were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube.
              Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray imagepredating, by a
              few weeks, Wilhelm R\F6ntgen's December 1895 announcement of the
              discovery of X-rays when he tried to photograph Mark Twain
              illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge
              tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking
              screw on the camera lens.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1898</strong> - Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a
              coherer-based radio controlwhich he dubbed "telautomaton"to the
              public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. The
              crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about
              the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being
              piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside. Tesla tried to sell his
              idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but
              they showed little interest.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1900</strong> - Returning to New York, Tesla began
              construction on Long Island of a wireless world broadcasting tower,
              with $150,000 capital from the American financier J. Pierpont
              Morgan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1906</strong> - He demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150
              kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 19101911, at the
              Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless
              turbine engines were tested at 1005,000 hp.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1912</strong> - He crafted "a plan to make dull students
              bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," wiring
              the walls of a schoolroom and, "saturating [the schoolroom] with
              infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole
              room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving
              and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1917</strong> - On the magazine "Electrical Experimenter",
              Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines
              via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous
              frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a
              system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to
              modern radar).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1928</strong> - Tesla received U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a
              biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then of
              being "gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator
              devices" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1932</strong> - Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that
              would run on cosmic rays. He told reporters that, after 35 years of
              work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of
              energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was "violently
              opposed" to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an
              apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1937</strong> - At the age of 81, after midnight one night,
              Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the
              cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a
              couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving
              taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched
              and three of his ribs were broken in the accident.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1943</strong> - On 7 January, at the age of 86, Tesla died
              alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.
